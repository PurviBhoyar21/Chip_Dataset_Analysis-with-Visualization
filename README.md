Hey there,
Welcome to this repository

This Project is based on data analysis and visualization.
I have taken a dataset that contains chips records i.e. type of chip, manufacturer, chip weight, sales(monthly,yearly) , loss, profit ,etc. 
This dataset is from Quantium virtual Experience program.

Number of datasets- 2 (purchase dataset, Transaction dataset).

IDE used is Google colab.

Go through the code to see analysis and my visualization .

Thank you
